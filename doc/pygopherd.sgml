  <title>Introduction to PyGopherd</title>
  <para>
    Welcome to &PyGopherd;.  In a nutshell, &PyGopherd;
    is a modern dynamic
    multi-protocol hierarchical information server with a pluggable
    modularized extension system, 
    full flexible caching, virtual files and
    folders, and autodetection of file types -- all with support for
    standardized yet extensible per-document metadata. Whew! Read on for
    information on this what all these buzzwords mean.

    <title>Features</title>
    <para>
      Here are some of &PyGopherd;'s features:
    </para>
    
    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem><para>Provides built-in support for multiple protocols:
	  HTTP (Web), Gopher+, Gopher (RFC1436), Enhanced Gopher0,
	  and WAP (mobile phones).  Protocols can be enabled or
	  disabled as desired.
	</para>
      </listitem>
      
      <listitem><para>Provides protocol autodetection.  That is,
	  &PyGopherd; can listen for all the above protocols
	  <emphasis>on a single port</emphasis> and will
	  automatically respond using the protocol it detects the
	  client is using.  Practical effects of this are that you
	  can, for instance, give out a single URL and have it
	  viewable normally on desktop Web browsers and in WAP
	  mode on mobile phones -- and appropriately in various
	  Gopher browsers.
	</para>
      </listitem>
      
      <listitem><para>Metadata and site links can be entered in a
	  variety of formats, including full UMN dotfile metadata
	  formats as well as Bucktooth gophermap files.  Moreover,
	  gophermap files are not limited to Gopher protocols, and
	  can be used for all protocols.
	</para>
      </listitem>
      
      <listitem><para>Support for inter-protocol linking (linking
	  from Gopher sites to web sites)</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem><para>Virtual folder system lets you serve up
	  anything as if it were regular files and directories.
	  PyGopherd comes with the following virtual folder systems
	  built in:</para>
	<itemizedlist>
	  <listitem><para>Can present any Unix MBOX, MMDF box, MH
	      directory, Maildir directory, or Babyl mailbox as a
	      virtual folder, the contents of which are the
	      messages in the mailbox.
	    </para>
	  </listitem>
	  <listitem><para>Can use a configurable separator to
	      split a file into multiple parts, the first line of each
	      becoming the name for the virtual folder.</para>
	  </listitem>
	  <listitem><para>Can peek inside a ZIP file and serve it
	      up as first-class site citizens -- metadata can even be
	      stored in the ZIP files.
	    </para>
	  </listitem>
	  <listitem><para>Can serve up the contents of a dictd
	      server as a filesystem.
	    </para>
	  </listitem>

	  executables.
	</para>
      </listitem>
      
      <listitem><para>
	  Runs on any platform supported by Python 2.2 or 2.3.
	  This includes virtually every past and current flavor of

	  directories by several orders of magnitude.  Because this is
	  a handler cache only, all protococls share the single

    <title>About Gopher</title>
    <para>
      &PyGopherd; started life as a server for the Gopher Internet
      protocol. With Gopher, you can mount a filesystem (viewing files and
      folders as if they were local),
      browse Gopherspace with a web browser,
      download files, and be interactive with searching.
    </para>
    
    <para>
      But this is only part of the story. The world of Gopher is more
      expansive than this. There are two major gopher protocols: Gopher0
      (also known as RFC1436) and Gopher+. Gopher0 is a small, simple,
      lightweight protocol that is very functional yet also extremely easy
      to implement. Gopher0 clients can be easily places in small embedded
      devices or in massive environments like a modern web browser.
    </para>
    
    <para>
      Gopher+ is based on Gopher0 but extends it by providing document
      metadata such as file size and MIME type. Gopher+ allows all sorts of
      neat features, such as configurable metadata (serving up a bunch of
      photos? Add a Subject field to your metadata to let
      a customized photo
      browser display who is pictured) and multiple
      views of a file (let the
      user select to view your photos as PNG or JPEG).

    If  you  are  reading this document via the "man" command, it is likely
    that you have no installation tasks to perform; your system administra-

    have three options: a system-wide installation with Debian, system-wide
    installation  with  other systems, and a single-user installation.  You
    can    download    the    latest    version    of    PyGopherd

<chapter id="configuration">
  <title>Configuration</title>
  <para>
    &PyGopherd; is regulated by a configuratoin file normally
    stored in <filename>/etc/pygopherd/pygopherd.conf</filename>.
    You can specify an alternate configuration file on the command
    line.  The &PyGopherd; distribution ships
    with a sample <filename>pygopherd.conf</filename> file that
    thoroughly documents the configuration file options and
    settings.
  </para>
</chapter>

<chapter id="handlers">
  <title>Handlers</title>
  <para>
    &PyGopherd; defines several handlers which are responsible for
    finding data on your server and presenting it to the user.  The
    handlers are used to generate things like links to other documents and
    directory listings.  They are also responsible for serving up regular
    files and even virtual folders.
  </para>
  
  <para>
    Handlers are specified with the <property>handlers</property>
    option in <filename>pygopherd.conf</filename>.  This option is
    a list of handlers to use.  For each request that arrives,
    &PyGopherd; will ask each handler in
    turn whether or not it can handle the request, and will handle the
    request according to the first handler that is capable of doing so.
    If no handlers can handle the request, a file not found error is
    generated.  See the example configuration file for an example.
  </para>
  
  <para>
    The remaining parts of this section describe the different
    handlers that ship with &PyGopherd;.
  </para>
  
  <sect1 id="handlers.dirhandler">
    <title>dir.DirHandler</title>
    <para>
      This handler is a basic one that generates menus based
      on the contents of a directory.  It is used for
      directories that contain neither a
      <filename>gophermap</filename> file nor UMN-style links
      files, or situations where you have no need for either
      of those.
    </para>
    <para>
      This handler simply reads the contents of your on-disk
      directory, determines the appropriate types of each file,
      and sends the result to the client.  The descriptions of
      each item are usually set to the filename, but the
      <property>html.HTMLFileTitleHandler</property> may override
      that.
    </para>
  </sect1>
      
  <sect1 id="handlers.buckgophermap">
    <title>gophermap.BuckGophermapHandler</title>
    <para>
      This handler is used to generate directory listings
      based on <filename>gophermap</filename> files.  It will
      not read the directory on-disk, instead serving content
      from the <filename>gophermap</filename> file only.
      Gophermaps are useful if you want to present a directory
      in which the files do not frequently change and there is
      general information to present.  Overall, if you only
      wish to present information particular to certain files,
      you should consider using the abstract feature of
      UMN.UMNDirHandler.
    </para>
    <para>
      The <filename>gophermap</filename> files contain two
      types of lines, which are described here using the same
      convention normally used for command line arguments.  In
      this section, the symbol \t will be used to indicate a
      tab character, Control-I.
    </para>

      <arg choice="Plain"><replaceable>full line of informational
	  text</replaceable></arg>

    </cmdsynopsis>
    <para>
      Note: spaces shown above are for clarity only and should
      not actually be present in your file.
    </para>
    <para>
      The informational text must not contain any tab
      characters, but may contain spaces.  Informational text
      will be rendered with gopher type
      <property>i</property>, which will cause it to be
      displayed on a client's screen at its particular
      position in the file.
    </para>
    <para>
      The second type of line represents a link to a file or
      directory.  It begins with a single-character Gopher
      type (see Gopher Item Types below) followed immediately
      by a description and a tab character.  There is no space
      or other separator between the gopher type and the
      description.  The description may contain spaces but not
      tabs.
    </para>
    
    <para>
      The remaining arguments are optional, but only to the
      extent that arguments may be omitted only if all
      arguments after them are also omitted.  These arguments
      are:
    </para>
    <variablelist>
      <varlistentry><term><replaceable>selector</replaceable></term>
	<listitem><para>The <property>selector</property> is
	    the name of the file on the server.  If it begins
	    with a slash, it is an absolute path; otherwise,
	    it is interpreted relative to the directory that
	    the gophermap file is in.  If no selector is
	    specified, the description is also used as the
	    selector.

      </varlistentry>
      <varlistentry><term><replaceable>host</replaceable></term>
	    <listitem><para>The <property>host</property>

      </varlistentry>
      <varlistentry><term><replaceable>port</replaceable></term>
	<listitem><para>The <property>port</property>

	</listitem>
      </varlistentry>
    </variablelist>
    <para>
      An example of a gophermap to help illustrate the concept
      is included with the &PyGopherd; distribution in the
      file <filename>examples/gophermap</filename>.
    </para>
  </sect1>
    
  <sect1 id="handlers.compressedfilehandler">
    <title>file.CompressedFileHandler</title>
    <para>
      In order to save space, you might want to store
      documents on-disk in a compressed format.  But then
      clients would ordinarily have to decompress the files
      themselves.  It would be nice to have the server
      automatically decompress the files on the fly, sending
      that result to the client.  That's where
      <property>file.CompressedFileHandler</property> comes
      in.
    </para>
    <para>
      This handler will take compressed files, pipe them
      through your chosen decompression program, and send the
      result directly to clients -- completely transparently.
    </para>
    <para>
      To use this handler, set the
      <property>decompressors</property> option in the
      configuration file.  This option defines a mapping from
      MIME encodings (as defined with the
      <property>encoding</property> option) to decompression
      programs.  Files that are not encoded, or which have an
      encoding that does not occur in the
      <property>decompressors</property> map, will not be
      decompressed by this handler.
    </para>
    <para>
      Please see the sample configuration file for more
      examples and details about the configuration of this
      handler.
    </para>
  </sect1>

  <sect1 id="handlers.filehandler">
    <title>file.FileHandler</title>
    <para>
      The <property>file.FileHandler</property> is just that
      -- its duty is to serve up regular files to clients.
    </para>
  </sect1>

  <sect1 id="handlers.htmlfiletitlehandler">
    <title>html.HTMLFileTitleHandler</title>
    <para>
      This handler is used when generating directories and
      will set the description of HTML files to the HTML title
      defined in them rather than let it be the default
      filename.  Other than that, it has no effect.  UMN
      gopherd implements a similar policy.
    </para>
  </sect1>

  <sect1 id="handlers.mailboxes">
    <title>mbox handlers</title>
    <para>
      There are four mailbox handlers:
    </para>
    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem><para>mbox.MaildirFolderHandler</></>
      <listitem><para>mbox.MaildirMessageHandler</></>
      <listitem><para>mbox.MBoxMessageHandler</></>
      <listitem><para>mbox.MBoxFolderHandler</></>
    </itemizedlist>
    <para>
      These four handlers provide a unique "virtual folder"
      service.  They allow you to present mailboxes as if they
      were folders, the items of the folders being the
      messages in the mailbox, organized by subject.  This is
      useful for presenting mail archives or just making
      e-mail accessible in a nice and easy fashion.
    </para>
    <para>
      To use these handlers, all you have to do is enable them
      in your <property>handlers</property> section.  They
      will automatically detect requests for mailboxes and
      handle them appropriately.
    </para>
    <para>
      The different handlers are for traditional Unix mbox
      mailboxes (all messages in a single file) and new
      qmail-stype Maildir mailboxes.  You can enable only the
      two handlers for the specific mailbox type that you use,
      if desired.
    </para>
  </sect1>

  <sect1 id="handlers.pyghandler">
    <title>pyg.PYGHandler</title>
    <para>
      PYG (short for PYGopherd) is a mechanism that provides a
      tremendous amount of flexibility.  Rather than just
      letting you execute a script like other Gopher or HTTP
      servers, PYGs are actually loaded up into PyGopherd and
      become fully-capable first-class virtual handlers.  Yet
      they need not be known ahead of time, and are loaded
      dynamically.
    </para>
    <para>
      With a PYG handler, you can generate gopher directories,
      handle searches, generate files, and more on the fly.
      You can create entire virtual directory trees (for
      instance, to interface with NNTP servers or with DICT
      servers), and access them all using the standard Gopher
      protocol.  All of this without having to modify even one
      line of &PyGopherd; code.
    </para>
    <para>
      If enabled, the <property>pyg.PYGHandler</property> will
      look for files with the extension .pyg that are marked
      executable.  If found, they will be loaded and run as
      PYGs.
    </para>
    <para>
      Please note: this module provides the capability to
      execute arbitrary code.  Please consider the security
      ramifications of that before enabling it.
    </para>
    <para>
      See the <property>virtual.Virtual</property> handler for
      more information about passing data to your scripts at
      runtime.
    </para>
    <para>
      At present, documentation on writing PYGs is not
      provides, but you may find examples in the
      <property>pygfarm</property> directory included with the
      &PyGopherd; distribution.
    </para>
  </sect1>

  <sect1 id="handlers.exechandler">
    <title>scriptexec.ExecHandler</>
    <para>
      This handler implements "old-style" script execution;
      that is, executing arbitrary programs and piping the
      result to the client.  It is, for the most part,
      compatible with both scripts written for UMN gopherd and
      the Bucktooth gopher server.  If enabled, it will
      execute any file that is marked executable in the
      filesystem.  It will normally list scripts as returning
      plain text, but you may create a custom link to the
      script that defines it as returning whatever kind of
      file you desire.  Unlike PYGs, this type must be known
      in advance.

    <title>UMN.UMNDirHandler</title>
    <para>
      This is one of the most powerful workhorse handlers in
      &PyGopherd;.  It is designed to emulate most of the ways
      in which the UMN gopherd distribution generates
      directories, even going so far as to be bug-compatible
      in some cases.  Generating directories with this handler
      is often the best general-purpose way to make nice
      directories in gopherspace.
    </para>
    <para>
      The remainder of the description of the
      <property>UMN.UMNDirHandler</property>, except for the
      Abstracts and Info section, is lifted directly from the
      original UMN gopherd documentation, with light editing,
      because this handler implements it so exactly that there
      was no point in rewriting all that documentation :-)
    </para>

    <sect2 id="handlers.umn.links">
      <title>Links</title>
      <para>
	You can override the default view of a directory as
	generated by <property>dir.DirHandler</property> by
	creating what are known as <emphasis>Links</emphasis> in
	the data tree.
      </para>
      <para>
	The ability to make links to other hosts is how gopher
	distributes itself among multiple hosts.  There are two
	different ways to make a link.  The first and simplest is
	to create a link file that contains the data needed by the
	server.  By default all files in the gopher data directory
	starting with a period are taken to be link files.  A link
	file can contain multiple links.  To define a link you
	need to put five lines in a link file that define the
	needed characteristics for the document.  Here is an
	example of a link.
      </para>
      <programlisting>
Name=Cheese Ball Recipes
Numb=1
Type=1
Port=150
Path=1/Moo/Cheesy
Host=zippy.micro.umn.edu
      </programlisting>

      <para>
	The Name= line is what the user will see when cruising
	through the database.  In this case the name is "Cheese
	Ball Recipes".  The "Type=" defines what kind of document
	this object is.  For a list of all defined types, see
	Gopher Item Types below.  For Gopher+ and HTTP, a MIME
	type is also used, which is determined automatically based
	on the type you specify.
      </para>
      
      <para>
	The "Path=" line contains the selector string that the
	client will use to retrieve the actual document.  The
	Numb= specifies that this entry should be presented first
	in the directory list (instead of being alphabetized).
	The "Numb=" line is optional.  If it is present it cannot
	be the last line of the link.  The "Port=" and "Host="
	lines specify a fully qualified domain name (FQDN) and a
	port respectively.  You may substitute a plus '+' for
	these two parameters if you wish.  The server will insert
	the current hostname and the current port when it sees a
	plus in either of these two fields.
      </para>
      
      <para>An easy way to retrieve links is to use the Curses
	Gopher Client.  By pressing '=' You can get information
	suitable for inclusion in a link file.
      </para>
    </sect2>
      
    <sect2 id="handlers.umn.overriding">
      <title>Overriding Defaults</title>
      <para>
	The server looks for a directory called
	<filename>.cap</filename> when parsing a directory.  The
	server then checks to see if the <filename>.cap</filename>
	directory contains a file with the same name as the file
	it's parsing.  If this file exists then the server will
	open it for reading.  The server parses this file just
	like a link file.  However, instead of making a new
	object, the parameters inside the
	<filename>.cap/</filename> file are used to override any
	of the server supplied default values.
      </para>
      
      <para>
	For instance, say you wanted to change the Title of a text
	file for gopher, but don't want to change the filename.
	You also don't want it alphabetized, instead you want it
	second in the directory listing.  You could make a
	set-aside file in the <filename>.cap</> directory with the same
	filename that contained the following lines:
      </para>
      
      <programlisting>
Name=New Long Cool Name
Numb=2
      </programlisting>

      <para>
	An alternative to <filename>.cap</filename> files are
	extended link files.  They work just the same as the files
	described in Links above, but have a somewhat abbreviated
	format.  As an example, if the name of the file was
	<filename>file-to-change</filename>, then you could create
	a file called <filename>.names</filename> with the
	following contents:
      </para>

      <programlisting>
Path=./file-to-change
Name=New Long Cool Name
Numb=2
      </programlisting>
    </sect2>

    <sect2 id="handlers.umn.cool">
      <title>Adding Cool Links</title>
      <para>
	One cool thing you can do with .Links is to add neato
	services to your gopher server.  Adding a link like this:
      </para>
      
      <programlisting>
Name=Cool ftp directory
Type=h
Path=/URL:ftp://hostname/path/
Host=+
Port=+
 
Name=Cool web site
Type=h
Path=/URL:http://hostname/
Host=+
Port=+
      </programlisting>
      <para>
	Will allow you to link in any FTP or Web site to your
	gopher.  (See url.URLHandler for more details.)
      </para>
      
      <para>
	You can easily add a finger site to your gopher server thusly:
      </para>
      
      <programlisting>
Name=Finger information
Type=0
Path=lindner
Host=mudhoney.micro.umn.edu

    <sect2 id="handlers.umn.hiding">
      <title>Hiding an Entry</title>
      <para>
	This kind of trick may be necessary in some cases,
	and thus for
	object "fred", the overriding .names file entry would be:
      </para>
      
      <programlisting>
Type=X
Path=./fred
      </programlisting>

      <para>
	by overriding default type to be "X".  This kind of
	hideouts may be usefull, when for some reason there are
	symlinks (or whatever) in the directory at which
	&PyGopherd; looks at, and those entries are not desired to
	be shown at all.
      </para>
    </sect2>

    <sect2 id="handlers.umn.abstracts">
      <title>Abstracts and Info</title>
      <para>
	Many modern gopher server maintainers like to intersperse
	gopher directory listings with other information -- often,
	additional information about the contents of files in the
	directory.  The gophermap system provides one way to do
	that, and abstracts used with UMN gopher directories
	provides another.
      </para>
      <para>
	Subject to the <property>abstract_headers</> and
	<property>abstract_entries</property> configuration file
	options, this feature allows you to define that extra
	information.  You can do that by simply creating a file
	named <filename>filename.abstract</filename> right
	alongside the regular file in your directory.  The file
	will be interpreted as the abstract.  For a directory,
	create a file named <filename>.abstract</filename> in the
	directory.  Simple as that!
      </para>
    </sect2>
  </sect1>

  <sect1 id="handlers.htmlurlhandler">
    <title>url.HTMLURLHandler</title>
    <para>
      &PyGopherd; provides ways for you to link to pages outside
      Gopherspace -- that is, web pages, FTP sites, and the like.
      This is accomplished according to the <ulink
	url="http://lists.complete.org/gopher@complete.org/2002/02/msg00033.html.gz">Links
	to URL</ulink> specification (see Conforming To below for
      details).  In order to link to a URL (EXCEPT gopher URLs)
      from a menu, you create a link of type h (regardless of the
      actual type of the resource that you are linking to) in your
      <filename>gophermap</filename> or
      <filename>.Links</filename>
      file that looks like this:
    </para>
    <programlisting>
/URL:http://www.complete.org/
    </programlisting>
    <para>
      Modern Gopher clients that follow the Links to URL
      specification will automatically follow that link when you
      select it.  The rest need some help, and that's where this
      handler comes in.
    </para>
    <para>
      For Gopher clients that do not follow the Links to URL
      specification, the <property>url.HTMLURLHandler</property>
      will automatically generate an HTML document for them on the
      fly.  This document includes a refresh code that will send
      them to the proper page.  You should not disable this
      handler.
    </para>
  </sect1>

  <sect1 id="handlers.urltyperewriter">
    <title>url.URLTypeRewriter</title>
    <para>
      Some people wish to serve HTML documents from their Gopher
      server.  One problem with that is that links in Gopherspace
      include an extra type character at the beginning, whereas
      links in HTTP do not.  This handler will remove the extra
      type character from HTTP requests that come in, allowing a
      single relative-to-root link to work for both.
    </para>
  </sect1>

  <sect1 id="handlers.virtual">
    <title>virtual.Virtual</title>
    <para>
      This handler is not intended to ever be used directly, but
      is used by many other handlers such as the mbox support, PYG
      handlers, and others.  It is used to generate virtual
      entries in the directory hierarchy -- that is, entries that
      look normal to a client, but do not actually correspond to a
      file on disk.
    </para>
    <para>
      One special feature of the
      <property>virtual.Virtual</property> handler is that you can
      send information to it at runtime in a manner similar to a
      CGI script on the web.  You do this by adding a question
      mark after the regular selector, followed by any arbitrary
      data that you wish to have sent to the virtual request
      handler.
    </para>
  </sect1>

  <sect1 id="handlers.zip">
    <title>ZIP.ZIPHandler</title>
    <para>
      Using zip.ZIPHandler, you can save space on your server by
      converting part or all of your site into a ZIP file.
      &PyGopherd; can use the contents of that ZIP file as the
      contents of your site -- completely transparently.
    </para>
    <para>
      The ZIP file handler must be enabled in the configuration
      file for this to work.
